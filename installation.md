# Linux RTAI installation - in contruction
These are the steps I have done in order to install Linux RTAI on a x86 machine.  
	0. Install a stable Ubuntu distro (in my case, 18.04); at this point it doesn't matter the Linux kernel version.  
	1. Download a stable Linux RTAI version (in my case, 5.3).  
	2. Unpack it under `/usr/src/ folder`.  
	3. Under `rtai-x.y/base/arch/x86/patches/` there are a list of patches for various Linux (vanilla) kernels. Choose one (in my case, 4.19.177).  
	4. Download the Linux kernel (https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/) and unpack it under /usr/src/ folder.  
	5. Move into the unpacked linux kernel and run `patch â€“p1 < /usr/src/rtai-x.y/base/arch/x86/patches/hal-linux-<version>-x86-[...].patch`  
	6. `make menuconfig`  
		There are a lot of possible choices; in order to make it run I had to deselect IPIPE, HYPERV, Auditing (through SECURITYAPPARMOR) and Stack Protector automatic selection.  
	7. `sudo make -jN`replacing N with your number of cores  
	8. `sudo make_modules`  
	9. `sudo make install`  
	10. `sudo update-grub`  
	11. Reboot and choose the kernel version you just patched  
	12. Move into the rtai-version folder (in my case, I've copied it under /usr/src)  
	13. `make menuconfig`
		Set 1 in Machine -> Number of CPUs and set the right directory in General -> Installation directory (I personally suggest to create a folder realtime under /usr: /usr/realtime)  
	14. `make -jN`
	15. `sudo make install`
	
Then, you should be able to insmod rtai modules and to try latecy tests. If you have a pc with more core/processor, you should enable just one of them, modifing `/etc/default/grub` and setting `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="maxcpus=1" `, then hit `sudo update-grub` and reboot.
