## RTAI kernel modules examples
This folder contains some examples of RTAI kernel modules.  
In order to compile them, note that RTAi files must be located in /usr/realtime (if you have followed the installation guide of this repo you should be able to compile them without problems).  
Note that warning on "function xyz undefined" could be show during compilation, but still the code works. Inside every folder there is a README file that shows how to compile and run the code.
